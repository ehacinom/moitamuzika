# NOTE:
# Another valid option for 'pkey' is 'hash'

# "@Server:" starts the server spec:
# o Server spec is lines of server destination spec in the form "IP[:Port]" or
#   "Domain[:Port]".
# o Port is needed when a non-default port is used, see "@Port" spec below.
#
@Server:
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1:10011
[::127.0.0.1]:10012
a.b.com
a.b.com:10011

# "@Port:port" set the port number for any servers without a port spec.
# Optional, default is 10010.
#
@Port:10010

# "@Table:TableName" starts a table spec:
# o TableName is case insensitive.
# o Table spec is lines of column spec in the form "Type[,Atr]:ColName".
# o Column Type's are:
#   o S - String.
#   o F - Double precision floating point.
#   o L - 64-bit unsigned integer.
#   o LS - 64-bit signed integer.
#   o I - 32-bit unsigned integer.
#   o IS - 32-bit signed integer.
#   o IP - v4/v6 address.
# o Column Atr's are:
#   o PKEY - Must be "S" type. Mark the "bucket key". One column in the table
#            MUST have this attribute.
#   o TKEY - Must be "I" type. Mark the sort key (e.g., time).
#   o +KEY - Must be "S" type. Mark the merge key used during import.
#            If the merge key in the imported row is not in any existing row,
#            a new row will be added to the table. On the other hand, if a
#            matching row is found, the imported row will be "merged" with the
#            existing row. The default per-column "merge" action is "+LAST".
#            See the following "+*" attributes for details.
#   o +FIRST - Use the first imported value.
#   o +LAST - Use the latest imported value. This is the default merge action.
#   o +ADD - For numeric/string column. Add/append new value to existing value.
#   o +BOR - For numeric column. Bitwise-OR new value with existing value.
#   o +MIN - For numeric column. Use the lesser of new and existing value.
#   o +MAX - For numeric column. Use the greater of new and existing value.
#   o +NOZERO - Modify the behavior of "+*" actions. Do not use imported value
#            if it is equivalent to a numeric 0 or a blank string.

# "@Vector:TableName" starts a vector table spec.
# o A vector table is a table that has only one data row. It is often used to
#   store bucket level profile data.
# o The vector row is automatically initialized to all zero's or blank strings
#   when a bucket is created (even if no data is imported).
# o "merge" attributes (see table spec above) can be used in the column spec.
#   However, no "+KEY" is necessary, it is implicit for a vector.

# "@Var:" starts the Var table spec.
# o A var table holds a single row of data. The columns (or vars) are global
#   and NOT bucket specific.
# o There can only be one Var table spec.
# o Var columns can be used in most "aq_udb" operations. See the "aq_udb"
#   manual for details.
# o Even though there is no table name in the spec, the Var table can be
#   referenced using the pseudo table name "var".
# o Columns in this table are initialized to zero/blank. They can also be
#   reset to zero/blank at any time using "aq_udb -clr var".
# o Columns in this table can be set using
#   "aq_udb -scn var -var ColName ColVal -var ColName ColVal ...".
# o Columns in this table can be exported using "aq_udb -exp var"
#   o During export, the "merge" attributes are used to combine data rows from
#     multiple Udb servers.
# o "merge" attributes (see table spec above) can be used in the column spec.
#   Because of the special properties of this table, merge is done during
#   export and not import.
#
@Var:

#
# More tables/vector as needed. But there can only be one Var table.
